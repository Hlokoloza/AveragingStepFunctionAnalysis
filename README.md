# AveragingStepFunctionAnalysis
Python script for analyzing current data from gamma-irradiated carbon nanomaterials. It averages the current values at each voltage step, then plots the average values against voltage. The analysis includes error calculations and visualizations with error bars to assess data uncertainty.
